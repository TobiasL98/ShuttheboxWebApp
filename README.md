# How the Game works
* You begin with 9 Open Boxes. 
* The Aim of the Game is to shut as many Boxes as Possible.
* Roll Two Dices, then close one or more Boxes such that the Sum
  of the Boxes closed is equal to your Dice Roll. 
* The Game Ends when you're unable to close Boxes that are equal to your Dice Roll.
- Remember, a lower Score is better!

# How to play
* Roll the Dice
* Drop down Boxes, equal to the Sum of your Roll.
* Repeat until u can't shut any more Boxes.
* Click on "NÃ¤chster Spieler".
* Player Score is now shown on the bottom left corner.
- Remember, a lower Score is better!
